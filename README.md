# AOOP-Project

Welcome to AOOP-Project, an Advanced Object Oriented Programming project that showcases the use of various design patterns and multi-threading techniques in creating a Java swing application. The project simulates a Zoo environment where different animals are summoned and interact with each other through eating and growing.

The project is implemented using Java Swing for the user interface and utilizes design patterns such as the Singleton, Observer, and Strategy pattern for efficient and organized code structure. The simulation also makes use of multi-threading for improved performance and concurrent processing, allowing for smooth and seamless interactions between the animals in the simulation.

One of the key features of this project is the use of images and interfaces for summoning the animals. The project also includes a wide variety of animals, each with their own unique behaviors and characteristics. The use of design patterns and multi-threading ensures that the simulation runs smoothly and efficiently, making it a great example of best practices in object-oriented programming.

Overall, this project is a great learning resource for anyone interested in understanding how to effectively use design patterns and multi-threading in their own Java projects.
